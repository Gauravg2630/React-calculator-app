# 🔢 React Calculator App

A simple calculator built using **ReactJS** as part of my **#100DaysOfReact** challenge. This project covers component reusability, state management, event handling, and expression evaluation.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating reusable components (`Button`)
- Managing input and state with `useState`
- Using a grid layout for buttons
- Handling expressions and basic evaluation logic
- Styling with modular CSS

---

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗  
- Clear button to reset (`C`)
- Evaluation of expressions with `=`
- Reusable button component
- Responsive, clean UI

⚠️ Note
This calculator uses JavaScript’s eval() for evaluating expressions, which is not safe for production. For advanced apps, consider using a parser like mathjs.
